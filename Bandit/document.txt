Bandit

It is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. Bandit processes/scans each file and once it has finished scanning all the files, it generates a report.

Command to install: pip install bandit

Example usage across a code tree:

bandit -r ~/your_repos/project

'-r' is used when you want to scan a directory

e.g. PS C:\Work\Shahzaib\kafka-practice> bandit -r .\

To check single file use command: bandit <file path>

e.g. PS C:\Work\Shahzaib\kafka-practice> bandit .\consume.py

If your code contains lines that trigger vulnerability errors, and you're sure it's okay, you can silence them by adding "# nosec" at the end of each line. In such cases, it is good practice to add a comment explaining why a given line was excluded from security checks.
