unit testing(Talisman)


Talisman is a tool that installs a hook to your repository to ensure that potential secrets or sensitive information do not leave the developer's workstation.

It validates the outgoing changeset for things that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens, private keys etc.


Talisman can be installed and used in one of the following ways:

As a git hook as a global git hook template and a CLI utility (for git repo scanning)
As a git hook into a single git repository
Talisman can be set up as either a pre-commit or pre-push hook on the git repositories.

Disclaimer: Secrets creeping in via a forced push in a git repository cannot be detected by Talisman. A forced push is believed to be notorious in its own ways, and we suggest git repository admins to apply appropriate measures to authorize such activities.
